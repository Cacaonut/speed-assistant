## Technical information
The data is taken from the [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) databases via the Overpass API. Therefore an internet connection is needed.
To correct data, use the [OSMs](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) query function to check if the issue is caused by wrong or incomplete data in the OSM databases. If so, you can edit it there.
